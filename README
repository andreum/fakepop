This is a simple binary file for linux that allows a inetd, tcpd or 
xinetd-run pop server, i.e.  one that reads data from stdin and writes 
to stdout, to deal with I/O overload by running a dummy POP session 
if the load is above a certain threshold.

This software was made for internal use and has no frills, no run-time 
configuration without recompilation. It comes AS IS, without support or
any warranty. It is put under an Apache license in the hope that it will
be useful.

It was a 3-hour effort and sice it served its purpose, no further.
development on it is expected. But you are free to use it as you see
fit, incorporate in other software, even sell it if you need to, I
only request that you give credit to it according to the License.
